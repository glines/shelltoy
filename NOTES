Next thing to do: Have ttoy close on shell exit.
Add shortcuts to increase and decrease the font size.

I got this assertion at exit once:
ttoy: /home/auntieneo/code/ttoy/src/pty.c:67: ttoy_PTY_pushEvent: Assertion `0' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)

This is a known issue with fontconfig. Fixing it seems to be a catch 22
situation, since the fontconfig documentation is not very clear on how to use
it properly:
ttoy: fccache.c:548: FcCacheFini: Assertion `fcCacheChains[i] == NULL' failed.
[1]    308 abort (core dumped)  ./result/bin/ttoy
